# V9938 MSX-VIDEO - Technical Data Book Programmer's Guide

Â© 1985 ASCII CORP. / NIPPON GAKKI CO., LTD.

## NOTE FROM THE EDITOR

This important technical book - including preface, dated back to 1985, had been 
reworked and modified appropriately in order to give more detailed explanation of how V9938 chip works and how to effectively program the system based on it.

While MSX gave up to the IBM PC standard as a computing platform in early 1990s, it is still one of the powerful specimens in the field of 8-bit home entertainment and hobbyist platforms. It is argued that modern PC architecture origins at the MSX standard; and it is clear that initiative, taken by Microsoft and ASCII by institutionalizing software and hardware compatibility was taken in further developments on the IT market.

V9938 is one of the most popular video-processors in the family of Texas Instruments original chips, improved by a group of companies from Japan and US. Its follower, V9958, was a VDP chip for limited release of MSX2+ and MSX Turbo-R machines, and the last VDP in the family, V9990, can only be found in add-on cartridges.

The book is provided in PDF format and is searchable to allow internet search engines indexing it so that potential readers would easily find it.

## PREFACE 

The V9938 introduced in this manual is a Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuit (VLSI) that was developed as a video Display Processor (VDP) for the MSX2. The MSX personal computer standard was introduced in 1983 by ASCII Corporation and Microsoft Incorporated. At present, the MSX is manufactured and marketed worldwide. In order to strengthen some of the functions of the original MSX, the MSX2 standard was developed in 1985. In addition to being software-compatible with the MSX, the MSX2 supports new media and has video processing capabilities that are not available on conventional 8-bit personal computers.

To make the MSX2 a reality, two requirements for the Video Processor were: upward compatibility with the existing TMS9918A (the VDP for the MSX) software and increased number of functions. The V9938 was developed through the joint efforts of ASCII Corporation, Microsoft Incorporated, and YAMAHA.

The following functions are supported on the V9938: 
- Full bit-mapped mode
- 80-column text display
- Access using X- and Y-coordinates for easier programming; the X-Y coordinates are independent of the screen mode
- Fundamental hardware commands to decrease the processing time and reduce programming complexity
- Digitize and external synchronization
- Color palette (9 bits x 16 patterns) 
- Linear RGB video output
- More sprites per horizontal line

Because the V9938 has the above functions, it provides superior video capabilities that make it possible for its use in a variety of applications, including the MSX2. CAPTAIN terminals and NAPLPS terminals using the V9938 have already been developed. We hope that the V9938 will be a standard video processing device on a worldwide basis.

This manual was written to explain how to set parameters of the v9938 and is a reference for developing applications and system software for it. We are pleased that you have chosen to develop software for the V9938 and that you have referred to this manual for assistance.

Finally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to the people at NTT as well as other related manufacturers for their valuable opinions which contributed to the development of the V9938.

## DEFINITIONS 

### A 

#### Attribute 
The property of an object, which controls how object looks like on the screen. Attribute can be a color, position of an object, or control which pixel should have specific color.

### B 

#### Background 
Is an object or property which is perceived to be in the background to another property or object. For example, for a character displayed on the screen the pixels of its image is said to have foreground color, while other pixels to have background color. In case of sprites, they may be said to appear in the foregrou nd to the font patterns, as sprites overlap images of the font. See also Foreground.

### C 

#### Collision 
Sprites are said to collide when their dots having color code 1 (simply saying - dots identified with binary 1s in their sprite pattern generator table) overlap. In some circumstances such behavior may be changed in favor or mixing sprite colors to have pseudo-multi-colored sprites.

#### Color 
A property of the pixel on the screen. Color of the pixel may come from various sources: from global color register, from pattern color table or from sprite color table. Colors can also be coded in the palette registers through setup of red, green and blue components - in this case, if color table of the patterns and sprites remain unchanged, actual colors, associated with them, may be different.

#### Command 
A special sequence of VDP operations, a kind of hardware acceleration. Command is expected to streamline CPU-VDP-VRAM operations, unload CPU and increase data transfer speed.

### E 

#### Expansion RAM
This random access memory is used to store non-displayed data or register information, and is not necessary for proper operation of the VDP. Maximal size or expansion RAM is 64K bytes. Due to specific purposes of this RAM, it is rarely used in applications.

### L

#### Layout
A map of patterns or sprites which identify where to display specific object or which object should be displayed in specific position. In case of patterns (font), Pattern generator Table identifies the appearance of font, but in order to display these patterns in specific position, programmer should put its number into Pattern Layout Table in respective location.

### O 

#### Object
Font patterns or a sprite.

### P

#### Pattern
A property of an object identifying how object looks like. Object can be a font pattern or a sprite pattern. Pattern may be represented by one byte or 8 bytes in different modes; its contents codes colors of the pixels displayed. For some modes, 8 bits (one byte) can code 8 pixels - 0 for background color and 1 for foreground color, in other modes 8 bits can code 4 pixels - with colors 0, 1, 2, and 3. To display font patterns on the screen it may not be enough to set its pattern, but also put its pattern number into the layout map. VDP, when displaying the picture, reads the number of pattern to display, and then refers to its actual image to font pattern generator table.

#### Port
Is a physical latch with specific system address for CPU reads and writes to communicate with VDP. VDP has four ports, port #0 is a read/write data port, port #1 is write register set-up port, port #2 is write palette port, and port #3 is write register data port.

### R

#### Register
Register is a static place within VDP for control information about VDP's mode, screen property etc. Registers can be Status, Video or Command. They can be accessed directly or indirectly. Access to the registers is made through consecutive writes to specific VDP ports, thus in order not to break the order and thus successful completion of specific operation, programmer should disable interrupts.

#### RGB
Abbreviation for base colors Red, Green and Blue. It may be used to describe hardware wiring with three analog signals; or to describe a color composition for the pixel. Note that when coding RGB in VDP palette registers programmer uses 3 bits for every base color, and when coding RGB in GRAPHIC 7 mode red and green occupy 3 bits each, but blue occupies only 2 bits.

### T

#### Tile
Same as font pattern .

### V

#### VRAM
Video Random Access Memory is a set of memory cells used by VDP to keep information about picture displayed on the screen. VRAM is accessed for picture displaying purposes as well as for picture modifications. Picture displaying occurs continuously when VDP is enabled. V9938 may have 16K to 128K VRAM, and depending on the memory organization and size may not be able to function properly in specific modes. See description of register R#8's bit VR for more information.

## BASIC INPUT AND OUTPUT

### Accessing the Control Registers

V9938 has 4 ports: port #0 - port #3; port number is selected by VDP address lines A0 and A1. Table below also shows port address allocation for MSX compatible machine.

||A1|A0|Operation|Primary MSX port (Hex)|
|---|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|
|Port #0|0|0|VRAM Data (R/W)|98h|
|Port #1|0|1|Status Register (R)<br>VRAM Address (W)<br>Register set-up (W)|99h|
|Port #2|1|0|Palette registers (W)|9Ah|
|Port #3|1|1|Register indirect addressing (W)|9Bh|

There are two ways to set data in the MSX-VIDEO control registers (R#0 to R#46).

#### Direct access to VDP registers

Output the data and the register number in sequence to port #1. The order of reads 
and writes to/from VDP ports is vitally important, thus you should keep in mind that this 
order can be potentially interrupted by CPU interrupt routine which can write to or read 
from VDP port(s) and thus break the proper sequence. In case of Z80 CPU, use DI 
(disable interrupts) at the start and EI (enable interrupts) at the end of VDP your access 
code.

Data byte is written first (bits D0-D7), and register number is written next to data 
byte (bits R0-R5). If interrupt involving VDP operations will occur between these two 
operations, it may cause unpredictable results.
```

                      +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

#### Indirect access to registers through R#17 (Control Register Pointer)

Set the register number in R#17 using direct addressing and then send data to Port #3. MSB of the value written to R#17 (AII) controls auto-incrementing of the register number. If auto-incrementing is enabled, after each data read or write control register pointer is incremented; if auto-incrementing is disabled then pointer value in R#17 remains unchanged. Auto-increment mode is useful for bulk read or update of VDP registers.

_**Note:** data in register R#17 can not be changed by indirect addressing._
```

                    |
                    +-- 0: Auto-increment is enabled
                    +-- 1: Auto-increment is disabled

                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

                 +====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+
                 :                  ...                  :
                 +====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+

                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

### Accessing the Palette Registers 
To set data in the MSX-VIDEO palette registers (P#0 to P#15) you must first set the palette register number in register R#16 (Color palette address pointer) and subsequently write two bytes of data (in specific order) into port #2. Every color consists of 3 sets of 3 bits: red, green and blue component (value 0...7).

_**Note:** after writing pair of data to port #2 palette register number (pointer) in register R#16 auto-increments._
```
              MSB  b7   b6   b5   b4   b3   b2   b1   b0  LSB
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
Register #16     | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | C3 | C2 | C1 | C0 | Palette #
                 +====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+
Port #2 1st byte | 0  | Red data     | 0  | Blue data    | Data 1

Port #2 2nd byte | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | Green data   | Data 2
                 +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

### Accessing the status registers

To read the status registers of MSX-VIDEO (S#0 to S#9) you must first set the 
register number in R#15 (Status register pointer) and then read data from port #1.
```
                  MSB  b7   b6   b5   b4   b3   b2   b1   b0  LSB
                     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
Register #15 (write) | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | S3 | S2 | S1 | S0 | Stat Reg #

Port #1 data (read)  | D7 | D6 | D5 | D4 | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 | Data read
                     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

### Accessing the Video RAM (VRAM)

A video RAM of 128K bytes plus an expansion RAM of 64K bytes can be attached to 
the VDP. Memory map is shown below.    Address    1FFFFh    â 
```
                      Address
+-----------------+  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·
|                 |   1FFFFh
|                 |
|                 |   10000h
+-----------------+  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·  +-----------------+
|                 |   0FFFFh    |                 |
|                 |             |                 |
|                 |   00000h    |                 |
+-----------------+  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·  +-----------------+
     Video RAM                      Expansion RAM
 (used for display)            (for data I/O registers)
```
To access memory, use the following procedure:
1. Switch respective bank (VRAM or expansion RAM)
2. Set the address counter A16 to A14
3. Set the address counter A7 to A0
4. Set the address counter A13 to A8, and specify if following data command will be 
read or write
5. Read or write data to the memory   

#### Step 1: Switching banks (VRAM to expansion RAM)

Applications are used to work with Video RAM, thus re-specification of the bank is rarely necessary. It will be required if your application will need to access expansion RAM. After performing necessary operations on expansion RAM, ensure that you map the Video RAM back.
```
           MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Register #45  |  0  | MXC | MXD | MXS | DIY | DIX | EQ  | MAJ | Argument
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ register
                       |                                        (ARG)
                       +--> 0: Video RAM
                       +--> 1: Expansion RAM
```

#### Step 2: Setting the address counter A16 to A14

VDP can logically address 128K bytes in the address range of 00000h-1FFFFh through 
16 address bits A16...A0. At this step we set up bits A16...A14 writing them into register R#14 (VRAM access base address register).
```
           MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Register #14  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | A16 | A15 | A14 | Base reg
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

#### Step 3: Setting the address counter A7 to A0

Set the low-order eight bits A7...A0 of the address counter by writing data to port #1.
```
           MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Port #1       | A7  | A6  | A5  | A4  | A3  | A2  | A1  | A0  | A7...A0
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

#### Step 4: Setting the address counter A13 to A8 and operation mode

Set the remaining six bits A13...A8 of the address counter by writing data to the port #1. You also should specify which memory operation will follow - read or write. It is very important, as if you specify that next operation will be a "read", VDP will pre-fetch value from the memory (specified by the address set up earlier) and will get ready for CPU data read.  
If you will not do so and issue read command, VDP may not get enough timeslot to read data from the VRAM and CPU may get invalid data.  
If you specify that next command will be a "write", then VDP does not do pre-fetch and waits for write instead.
```
           MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Port #1       |  0  |  W  | A13 | A12 | A11 | A10 | A9  | A8  | A13...A8
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                       |
                       +--> 0: Next command is "Data Read"
                       +--> 1: Next command is "Data Write"
```

#### Step 5: Reading or writing data to memory

It is important to know that after every data read or data write operation from port #0 address counter is being incremented. It is very useful when you need to read from or write to the memory in sequential manner. However you should mind the timing, ensuring that VDP has enough time to write cached data or read requested data. Please refer to the data sheet for timings.
```
           MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
Port #0       | D7  | D6  | D5  | D4  | D3  | D2  | D1  | D0  | Data Addr ++
              +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

#### Table Base address registers

When displaying information on the screen, VDP uses color, pattern, sprite and other information from video RAM. It is important to set proper starting addresses of such VRAM locations by writing to specified table base address registers.

_**Note:** you should ensure that unused bits are set to 0. Further in the book bit set to "0" will mean that this bit has to be set to 0, "1" will mean that this bit has to be set to 1, and "\*" will mean that value of the bit does not matter._

#### Color registers

Color registers are used to control MSX-VIDEO text and background screen colors, blinking and other functions.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#7     | TC3 | TC2 | TC1 | TC0 | BD3 | BD2 | BD1 | BD0 | Text & screen margin color
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#12    | T23 | T22 | T21 | T20 | BC3 | BC2 | BC1 | BC0 | Text & background blink color
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
|Names|Description|
|:-:|---|
|`TC3`..`TC0`|Text color in TEXT1 and TEXT2 modes.|
|`BD3`..`BD0`|Screen margin / backdrop color.|
|`T23`..`T20`|Blink foreground color (part 1).|
|`BC3`..`BC0`|Blink background color (part 0).|

In TEXT2 mode, if attributes for blinking are set, color set in this register R#12 and in register R#7 are displayed alternatively (blinked).

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#13    | ON3 | ON2 | ON1 | ON0 | OF3 | OF2 | OF1 | OF0 | Blinking period register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
|Names|Description|
|:-:|---|
|`ON3`..`ON0`|Display time for even page.|
|`OF3`..`OF0`|Display time for odd page.|


In the TEXT2 mode and in bit map modes of GRAPHIC4 to GRAPHIC7 two pages can be alternatively displayed (blinked). Write to this register R#13 in order for blinking to start.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#20    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | Color burst register 1
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#21    |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  | Color burst register 2
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#22    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  | Color burst register 3
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

The above values of color burst registers are preset on power-on. If all the bits in all three registers are set to 0, color burst of the composite video is not performed. If values are returned to above values, VDP will start generating normal color burst signal.

#### Display registers

The display registers are used to control display position on the screen.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#18    | V3  | V2  | V1  | V0  | H3  |  H2 | H1  | H0  | Display adjust register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

Register #18 controls horizontal and vertical alignment on the screen. Please refer to the table below.

||7|...|1|0|15|...|8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **H** |Left|...|...|Center|...|...|Right|
| **V** |Top|...|...|Center|...|...|Bottom|

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#23    | DO7 | DO6 | DO5 | DO4 | DO3 | DO2 | DO1 | DO0 | Vertical offset register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

This register R#23 sets the value of the first line to display on the screen. Virtual screen size is 256 lines, visible vertical screen size can be 192 or 212 depending on LN bit of register R#9. Setting R#23 to value other than 0 may display un-initialized parts of the memory which may look as garbage. Display of virtual screen is performed in cycle, meaning that when increasing value of R#23 top of virtual screen appears at the bottom of visible screen.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#19    | IL7 | IL6 | IL5 | IL4 | IL3 | IL2 | IL1 | IL0 | Interrupt line register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

VDP generates interrupt when it starts to display respective scan line if bit 4 "IE1" of register R#0 is set to 1. Write a value to this register R#19, and when VDP will start displaying the specified line, it will set bit 0 "FH" of status register S#1 to 1.

#### Access registers

Access registers is the set of registers used for accessing other VDP registers or VRAM.  
These registers include R#14, R#15, R#16 and R#17.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#14    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | A16 | A15 | A14 | VRAM access base register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
R#14 contains three senior bits of VRAM access address. In all modes, except GRAPHIC1, GRAPHIC2, MULTICOLOR and TEXT1, if there's a carry flag from A13 the value in this register is automatically incremented.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#15    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | S3  | S2  | S1  | S0  | Status register pointer
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
R#15 points to the respective status register (S#0...S#9) to be read.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#16    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | C3  | C2  | C1  | C0  | Color palette address register
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
R#16 points to the respective color palette register (P#0...P#15) to be accessed.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#17    | AII |  0  | RS5 | RS4 | RS3 | RS2 | RS1 | RS0 | Control register pointer
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```
R#17 is a register used in indirect access to other VDP registers. It also has auto-increment flag (AII) which is used to control increment of value in this register.

#### Command registers
The following command registers are used when executing a command on the MSX-VIDEO. Details on the use of these command registers will be presented in later chapter.

#### Pattern Generator Table

The pattern generator table is a location in VRAM that stores patterns (font). Each pattern has number from PN0 to PN255. The font displayed on the screen for each pattern is constructed from 8 bytes, with 6 high-order bits displayed and 2 low-order bits not displayed. Pattern generator table base is stored in the register R#4.

Example of pattern generator table is provided below.

#### Pattern Layout Table settings

The pattern layout table is a map of the screen (per screen image). Every location of the screen contains code of the pattern displayed at respective location. This table has 40\*24 (960) locations where defined patterns can be displayed. Pattern layout table base address is stored in register R#2, and corresponds to the cell (0, 0) with address 0 in the picture below.

#### Color register settings

Color settings are located in the register R#7. Bits TC3...TC0 specify pattern color code of the pixels identified as "1" in the bitmap values of pattern generator table, bits BD3...BD0 specify pattern color code of the pixels identified as "0" in the bitmap values of pattern generator table as well as screen border color. 

_**Note:** screen border color is the same as the pattern backdrop color in TEXT1 mode._

#### Pattern Tables

The pattern generator table is a location in VRAM that stores patterns (font). Each pattern has number from PN0 to PN255, for every â of the screen. The font displayed on the screen for each pattern is constructed from 8 bytes, with all 8 bits of each byte displayed. Pattern generator table base is stored in the register R#4.

```

        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+  table base address
```

The pattern layout table is a map of the screen (per screen image). Every byte location of the screen contains code of the pattern displayed at respective location. This table has three 32\*8 locations (upper, middle and lower) arranged consecutively where defined patterns can be displayed. Pattern layout table base address is stored in register R#2, and corresponds to the cell (0, 0) with address 0 in the picture below. Example of pattern generator table is provided below. Color table identifies color 1 (upper four bits: Fh) and color 0 (lower four bits: 0h) for every row of the pattern.

#### Hardware tiling function

VDP can only display 4 solid colors in G5 mode however pixels are so small that combination of two pixels from the set of those 4 solid colors possible produces another visible color, a mixture of the applied two.

This feature is only available in G5 mode, and is applied to the sprites and to the screen border color. G5 has 512 pixels in its X-axis, but sprites' X-coordinate is between 0 and 255. This means that for single sprite dot there're two font pattern dots, and from forn pattern point of view sprite of 8\*8 has size of 16\*8.

SM2 sprite color table uses 4 bits for each line of sprite. For every dot in sprite pattern table defined as "1" in sprite image bitmap, lower two bits from this 4-bit set define color of odd pixels of the sprite, and higher two bits from this set define color of even pixels of the sprite.

In the example above imagine that palette color 1 is set to red (â 7, 0, 0) and color 3 
set to blue (â 0, 0, 7).

## COMMANDS

### Types of commands

Commands are used to perform specific complex operations on the video memory, and thus on the image displayed on the screen. See the list of available commands in the table below.

| Command name | Destination | Source | Unit | Mnemonic | CM3 | CM2 | CM1 | CM0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|High-speed move|VRAM|CPU|Byte|HMMC(*)|1|1|1|1|
|High-speed move|VRAM|VRAM|Byte|YMMM(*)|1|1|1|0|
|High-speed move|VRAM|VRAM|Byte|HMMM|1|1|0|1|
|High-speed move|VRAM|VDP|Byte|HMMV|1|1|0|0|
|Logical move|VRAM|CPU|Dot|LMMC|1|0|1|1| 
|Logical move|CPU|VRAM|Dot|LMCM|1|0|1|0|
|Logical move|VRAM|VRAM|Dot|LMMM|1|0|0|1|
|Logical move|VRAM|VDP|Dot|LMMV|1|0|0|0|
|Line|VRAM|VDP|Dot|LINE|0|1|1|1|
|Search|VRAM|VDP|Dot|SRCH|0|1|1|0|
|Pset|VRAM|VDP|Dot|PSET|0|1|0|1|
|Point|VDP|VRAM|Dot|POINT|0|1|0|0|
|Invalid|||||0|0|1|1|
|Invalid|||||0|0|1|0|
|Invalid|||||0|0|0|1|
|Stop||||STOP|0|0|0|0|

_(*) In G4 and G6 modes, the lower one bit, and in G5 mode, the lower two bits are lost in registers related to X-coordinate (DX, NX)._

The process of execution of VDP commands consists of several steps:

- Ensure that current mode is G4 - G7. In other modes result is not guaranteed.
- Check the bit 0 (CE, command execution) flag in status register S#2 to be 0. If it's 1, then previous command is in progress and program needs to wait for completion or issue STOP command.
- Set necessary parameters for command execution in registers R#32 to R#45 as necessary. It is easy to write whole the set of values to registers using indirect register addressing mode with auto-increment turned on.
- Write command code to the R#46 (CMR, command register).
- Wait till command execution is completed by checking bit 0 (CE) of S#2 to be 0.
- If current command needs to be aborted, execute STOP command.

### Page concept

As we have already seen, programmer can have several options to place tables in the video memory by altering base address registers. In some modes there're more options (like in Text 1 there're 32 options and in GRAPHICS7 there're only 2 options). This introduces a concept of the page defined by where VDP currently operates and where it takes information for picture display from. Page concept is stricter in relation to VDP ommands. VRAM access is defined by X and Y coordinates, and not by physical address within VRAM. Coordinate X is specified by 9 bits, and can be in range of 0..511, coordinate Y is specified by 10 bits, and can be in range of 0..1023. See the table below for VRAM paging in various video modes.

```

+-------------------+  1FFFFh  +-------------------+

      GRAPHIC7         Address        GRAPHIC6
+-------------------+  00000h  +-------------------+
|(0,0)       (255,0)|          |(0,0)       (511,0)|
|      Page 0       |          |      Page 0       |
|(0,255)   (255,255)|          |(0,255)   (511,255)|
+-------------------+  10000h  +-------------------+
|(0,256)   (255,256)|          |(0,256)   (511,256)|
|      Page 1       |          |      Page 1       |
|(0,511)   (255,511)|          |(0,511)  (511,511)|
+-------------------+  1FFFFh  +-------------------+
```

In G4 and G5 modes there're four pages; in G6 and G7 modes there're only two pages. For example, setting Y coordinate in G5 mode to 658 will automatically choose page #2 with specific translated initial VRAM address.

Note that VDP is capable of displaying maximum of 212 lines, and programmer has an option to use register R#23 to set visible screen window position within active page.

### Logical operations

When executing logical commands LINE, PSET and LOGICAL MOVE, it is possible to define logical operation to be done on the color of the pixels. The four bits identifying the logical operation should be written in lower four bits of R#46 (command register) together with the command code.

| Name | Operation | LO3 | LO2 | LO1 | LO0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|IMP|DC=SC|0|0|0|0|
|AND|DC=SC&DC|0|0|0|1|
|OR|DC=SC|DC|0|0|1|0|
|XOR|DC=SC^DC|0|0|1|1|
|NOT|DC=!SC|0|1|0|0|
|Invalid||0|1|0|1|
|Invalid||0|1|1|0|
|Invalid||0|1|1|1|
|TIMP|If SC=0 then DC=DC<br>else DC=SC|1|0|0|0|
|TAND|If SC=0 then DC=DC<br>else DC=SC&DC|1|0|0|1|
|TOR|If SC=0 then DC=DC<br>else DC=SC\|DC|1|0|1|0|
|TXOR|If SC=0 then DC=DC<br>else DC=SC^DC|1|0|1|1|
|TNOT|If SC=0 then DC=DC<br>else DC=!SC|1|1|0|0|
|Invalid||1|1|0|1|
|Invalid||1|1|1|0|
|Invalid||1|1|1|1|

_*SC = source color code._  
_*DC = destination color code._

### Explanation of the commands 
 
#### HMMC (High speed move CPU to VRAM)

HMMC command is used to transfer data from the CPU to video or expansion RAM into a specified rectangular area through VDP. When using this command, note the limitation on the X coordinate in various modes (255 or 511).

```
                          Video or expansion RAM

                        +-------------------------+
```

##### HMMC execution order

**Step 1:** Set necessary coordinates in command registers.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#38    | DY7 | DY6 | DY5 | DY4 | DY3 | DY2 | DY1 | DY0 | DY: Destination Y
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#39    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | DY9 | DY8 |
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#40    | NX7 | NX6 | NX5 | NX4 | NX3 | NX2 | NX1 | NX0 | NX(*): Number of dots in X-axis
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#41    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | NX8 |

R#42    | NY7 | NY6 | NY5 | NY4 | NY3 | NY2 | NY1 | NY0 | NY: Number of dots in Y-axis
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#43    |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | NY9 | NY8 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

_(*)_ In G4 and G6 modes, the lower one bit, and in G5 mode, the lower two bits are lost in registers related to X-coordinate (DX, NX).

**Step 2:** Set color register value

The first byte transferred from CPU after starting executing the HMMC command should be located in color register R#44 (CLR). Format of color data depends on the graphics mode.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#44    | CH3 | CH2 | CH1 | CH0 | CL3 | CL2 | CL1 | CL0 | G4, G6 (N=0..127)
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                  X=2N                   X=2N+1
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | CH3 | CH2 | CH1 | CH0 | CL3 | CL2 | CL1 | CL0 | G5 (N=0...127)
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
            X=4N        X=4N+1     X=4N+2      X=4N+3
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | CH3 | CH2 | CH1 | CH0 | CL3 | CL2 | CL1 | CL0 | G7
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                          X=N (One dot)
```

**Step 3:** Select destination memory and direction from base coordinate

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
R#45    |  0  |  -  | MXD |  -  | DIY | DIX |  -  |  -  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                       |           |     |
                       |           |     +---> X direction: 0:Right 1:Left
                       |           +---------> Y direction: 0:Down 1:Up
                       +---------------------> Memory type: 0:VRAM 1:ExpRAM
```

**Step 4:** Execute the command

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
R#46    |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | HMMC cmd
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Step 5:** Send data and wait for completion

While command is being executed by VDP, CE bit of status register S#2 will be set to 1. When command is complete, it will be reset to 0.

When VDP sets TR bit of status register S#2 to "1" application can send next data to the VDP color register R#44 (CLR). If TR bit is 0, then appl ication should not send data and wait till TR bit is set to 1 or terminate the command if needed.

                                    Logical operation
```

**Step 5:** Send data and wait for completion 
 
While command is being executed by VDP, CE bit of status register S#2 will be set to 1. When command is complete, it will be reset to 0.

When VDP sets TR bit of status register S#2 to "1" application can send next data to the VDP color register R#44 (CLR). If TR bit is 0, then appl ication should not send data and wait till TR bit is set to 1 or terminate the command if needed.

                             +---------------> Source type: 0:VRAM 1:ExpRAM
```

**Step 3:** Clear the TR flag

Read the value from status register S#7. This step is required in order to clear the TR flag. Please refer to flowchart in this section for the LMCM command.

**Step 4:** Execute the LMCM command
 
```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Step 5:** Read dot color code and check command end

Use status register S#7 to get the color code of the dot. Format of color data depends on the graphics mode.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

#### LINE

LINE command is used to draw straight line in VRAM of expansion RAM. The line drawn is the hypotenuse of the triangle defined by the "long" and "short" sides. The distances are defined from the single starting point. Words "long" and "short" are used to identify respective sets of registers to use to define triangle's sides: long side is defined in registers R#40 and R#41 (by 10 bits MJ9..MJ0 with value in the range 0..1023) and short side is defined in registers R#42 and R#43 (by 9 bits MI8..MI0 with value in the range 0..511). The units used are dots.

If this bit is 0, then long side (NY) defines triangle's side by X-axis and short side (NX) defines triangle's side by Y-axis; if this bit is 1, then long side (NY) defines triangle's side by Y-axis and short side (NX) defines triangle's side by X-axis.

                                    Logical operation
```

**Step 5:** Check for command completion

CPU should check CE bit of status register S#2 to identify if VDP has completed execution of the command. When command is being executed, CE bit is set to 1; when command is complete, CE bit will be reset to 0.

#### SRCH

SRCH command is used to search for the specific color in VRAM of expansion RAM to the right or left of the starting point. The units used are dots.

```

        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Step 2:** Set color register value

Color to search for should be coded in color register R#44 (CLR). Format of color data depends on the graphics mode.

```
     MSB  b7    b6    b5    b4    b3    b2    b1    b0   LSB

        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Step 3:** Select destination memory, direction from base coordinate and orientation
 
Bit EQ of the register R#45 controls search stop condition. If it is set to 1, then SRCH command terminates when color, equal to R#44 coded color, is found; if it is set to 0, then SRCH command terminates when any other than R#44 coded color is found.

                       +---------------------------> Destination type: 0:VRAM 1:ExpRAM
```

**Step 4:** Execute the command

```

        +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Step 5:** Check for command termination or completion, and X-coordinate

Flag BD of the status register S#2 is se t if coded color in register R#44 was found, otherwise this bit is reset. Current value of the X-coordinate can be read from the status registers S#8 and S#9.

### Speeding up the processing of VDP commands

Programmer can use two methods to speed up VDP hardware acceleration commands. Use of both methods is related to decreasing VDP access to the VRAM and freeing available VRAM time slots for command execution.
- **Disabling sprites:** setting register R#8 bit SPD to 1 disables sprite processing.
- **Disabling screen display:** setting register R#1 bit BL to 0 will completely disable screen display freeing significant memory access time for command execution.

### States of the registers after command execution

Setting up VDP registers for command execution is a significant task for programmer and CPU, and it will be wise to use already existing values in the registers for the next command execution or for further work with video memory. For this purpose programmer should know the resulting states of most important VDP registers. Please see the table below. Note that if program is going to use sequence of the VDP commands which use resulting values of registers from previous commands, it is important to disable interrupts so that interrupt handler routing would not accidentally change values in VDP registers and thus break the whole command sequence.

CMR H is a higher nibble of the command register R#46; CMR L is a lower nibble of the command register r#46. ARG is an argument register R#45.

The resulting values of SY*, DY* and NY* are in dots and can be calculated using equations below:
- If DIY=0 then SY*=SY+N; DY*=DY+N 
- If DIY=1 then SY*=SY-N; DY*=DY-N 
- NY*=NY-N
- (LINE command ==> if MAJ=0 then N=N-1)

## SPRITES

MSX-VIDEO can display up to 32 sprites on the screen. Depending on the sprite mode, sprite sizes can be 8\*8 or 16\*16 dots. X-axis coordinate of sprite location is always between 0..255, and this means that in graphics modes with 512 dots on the X-axis single sprite's dot occupy two horizontal dots of the screen.

Sprites can be placed anywhere on the screen. Sprites are processed independently of and do not affect other graphics. They can be independently switched on or off.

The following diagram conceptually shows how sprites are displayed. Note that visible screen area may have 192 or 212 pixels depending on the setting of LN bit of register R#9, and visible screen area can be vertically scrolled using vertical offset register R#23.

```

     +-------------------------+
  (0,254)                  (255,254)
```
\* They Y-coordinate of the upper edge of the sprite screen is 255

The MSX-VIDEO can work in two sprite display modes. Respective mode is selected during initialization of the screen mode.
- Sprite mode 1: GRAPHIC1, GRAPHIC2, MULTICOLOR
- Sprite mode 2: GRAPHIC3 ... GRAPHIC7

Sprites are not available in TEXT1 and TEXT2 modes.

### SPRITE MODE 1 (G1, G2, MC)

While there's a room for 256 sprite patterns in sprite pattern generator table, VDP is only capable of displaying 32 sprites (#0..#31) - limiting factor is sprite attribute table which can hold attributes for 32 active sprites only.

Up to 4 sprites can be displayed on a single horizontal line, and from the set of displayed sprites on this line, the sprites with higher priority will be displayed, and the overlapping portions of lower priority sprites will not be displayed. Lower sprite numbers are assigned higher priority, with #0 is of highest priority and #31 is of lowest priority.

When two sprites collide (their pattern color 1 portions have overlapped), status register's S#0 bit 5 "C" is set to 1.

If there're more than 4 sprites on the single horizontal line, bit 6 of the status register S#0 "5S" is set to 1, and the lower order 5 bits of this status register S#0 will contain the number of the fifth sprite.

#### Global sprite attributes and tables (SM1)

Register R#1 contains two controls for sprites, allowing magnification and quadruple sprite pattern size.

Sprites are defined by two tables: sprite pattern generator table, which controls the appearance of the dots within the sprite (being on "1" or off "0") and sprite attribute table, which controls positioning, used pattern number and the sprite color.

#### Sprite attribute table (SM1)

The sprite attribute table is an area in the VRAM that defines display coordinates for all the possible 32 sprites, their colors, pattern numbers used for display and some other flags. Each sprite has four bytes of attribute data, making up 128 bytes (80h) of the memory.

Y-coordinate defines the vertical position of the sprite. Note that if Y is equal to 208 (D0h), all lower priority sprites will not be displayed. It is important to know that when using vertical offset register R#23 to scroll the visible area of the screen, sprite with the Y-coordinate of 208 will not be displayed and in order to display sprite in this area on the scrolled screen programmer should use Y-coordinate equal to 207 or 209.

Pattern number specifies which pattern from sprite pattern generator table to use to display the sprite bitmap image. If 8\*8 dots sprite size is selected, there're 256 patterns available, but if 16\*16 dots sprite size is selected, there there're only 64 patterns available. In 16\*16 mode two lower-order bits of the pattern number are not used (and they can hold any value).

Color code specifies color for pattern color 1 (of the dots which are set to "1" in the sprite bitmap image). The dots which are set to "0" in the sprite bitmap image will appear transparent.

EC (Early clock) is used to offset sprite by 32 dots to the left. This feature is useful when programmer needs to put sprite to the left off the screen.

#### Sprite pattern generator table (SM1)

Sprite pattern generator table is an area in the VRAM specifying the sprite patterns (appearance). Base address of this table should be set in register R#6.

Eight bytes are used for each pattern, and whole table occupies 2048 bytes (800h) for all the 256 patterns possible. Each pattern is assigned the number, #0 to #255. If sprite size of 8\*8 is selected (SI=0) then each displayed sprite has one pattern; if sprite size of 16\*16 is selected (SI=1) then each sprite is comprised of four patterns.

### SPRITE MODE 2 (G3 ... G7)

While there's a room for 256 sprite patterns in sprite pattern generator table, VDP is only capable of displaying 32 sprites (#0...#31) - limiting factor is sprite attribute table which can hold attributes for 32 active sprites only.

Up to 8 sprites can be displayed on a single horizontal line, and from the set of displayed sprites on this line, the sprites with higher priority will be displayed, and the overlapping portions of lower priority sprites will not be displayed. Lower sprite numbers are assigned higher priority, with #0 is of highest priority and #31 is of lowest priority. 

```
     +----------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                |
     | +---+                +---+  +---+  +---+         +---+         |
     | | 0 |  +---+  +---+  | 3 |  | 4 |  | 5 |  +---+  | 7 |  + Â· +  |
     | +---+  | 1 |  | 2 |  +---+  +---+  +---+  | 6 |  +---+  : 8 :  |
     |        +---+  +---+                       +---+         +---+  |
     |                                                                |
     +----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When two sprites collide (their solid "1" portions have overlapped), status register's S#0 bit 5 "C" is set to 1, and the coordinates of the collision can be read from status registers S#3..S#5.

If there're more than 8 sprites on the single horizontal line, bit 6 of the status register S#0 "5S" is set to 1, and the lower order 5 bits of this status register S#0 will contain the number of the ninth sprite.

The colors of the sprite are specified for each horizontal line.

The sprite priority may be cancelled by setting bit "CC" in the attribute table for specific line of the sprite, and if sprites overlap, logical "OR" will be done on the colors of the sprites. Therefore, while in sprite mode 1 sprites may only have two colors (color code 1 and transparent), in sprite mode 2 four colors may be displayed.

#### Global sprite attributes and tables (SM2)

Register R#1 contains two controls for sprites, allowing magnification and quadruple sprite pattern size. Register R#8 contains one control bit, "SPD", which allows disabling and enabling sprite display.

Sprites are defined by three tables: sprite pattern generator table, which controls the appearance of the dots within the sprite (being on "1" or off "0"), sprite color table, which control colors of the sprite lines and other attributes, and sprite attribute table, which controls positioning and used pattern number.

#### Sprite attribute table (SM2)

The sprite attribute table is an area in the VRAM that defines display coordinates for all the possible 32 sprites, pattern numbers used for display and some other flags. Each sprite has four bytes of attribute data, making up 128 bytes (80h) of the memory.

```

```

Y-coordinate defines the vertical position of the sprite. Note that if Y is equal to 216 (D8h), all lower priority sprites will not be displayed. It is important to know that when using vertical offset register R#23 to scroll the visible area of the screen, sprite with the Y-coordinate of 216 will not be displayed and in order to display sprite in this area on the scrolled screen programmer should use Y=coordinate equal to 215 or 217.

Pattern number specifies which pattern from sprite pattern generator table to use to display the sprite bitmap image. If 8\*8 dots sprite size is selected, there're 256 patterns available, but if 16\*16 dots sprite size is selected, there there're only 64 patterns available. In 16\*16 mode two lower-order bits of the pattern number are not used (and they can hold any value).

Color code is not used in sprite mode 2, and the respective area in the table is 
reserved.

```

#### Sprite pattern generator table (SM2)

Sprite pattern generator table is an area in the VRAM specifying the sprite patterns (appearance). Base address of this table should be set in register R#6.

Sprite pattern generator table is designed the same way as in SPRITE MODE 1 (SM1); please refer to respective section for the example. Eight bytes are used for each pattern, and whole table occupies 2048 bytes (800h) for all the 256 patterns possible. Each pattern is assigned the number, #0 to #255. If sprite size of 8\*8 is selected (SI=0) then each displayed sprite has one pattern; if sprite size of 16\*16 is selected (SI=1) then each sprite is comprised of four patterns.

#### Sprite color table (SM2)

In SPRITE MODE 2 (SM2) the sprite color table specifies sprite colors for each sprite line. Note that sprite color 0 (i.e. the dots having "0" for them in sprite pattern generator table) is transparent unless TP bit of register R#8 is set. Each entry also defines sprite priority, collision detection, and early clock sprite display options.

The base address of the sprite color table is calculated using base address of the sprite attribute table: sprite color table is located "strictly above" the sprite attribute table, having base address of sprite attribute table minus 512 (200h).

Every sprite is assigned 16 color entries in the sprite color table. If 8\*8 sprite size mode is selected, only first 8 color bytes are used for every sprite, with another 8 being not used. If 16\*16 sprite size mode is selected, then all 16 color bytes are used.

#### Priority mechanism and multicolored sprite combinations (SM2)

In sprite mode 2 (SM2), if the "CC" bit of the sprite color table entry is set to 1, the sprite priority mechanism is cancelled for the specified line. Collision mechanism does not work, mixing color codes of the lines of affected sprites using "OR" logical operation.

This logical color mixing will work for sprite N if its affected line has CC bit set, and this line will collide with the line of another sprite which has CC bit reset to "0" and has lower number (N-1, N-2, ..., 0 - i.e. higher priority).

Moreover, the line of the sprite having CC bit set to "1" will not be displayed at all if there will be no lower number sprite with the line with CC bit set to "0" at the same screen line. 

Please see below for the example for the sprite combination displayed in seven colors.

```
    +----------+ Â· Â· +
    |          |     :     Sprite #N
    |          |     :     Color code 8

```

#### Sprite collision

If CC bit is set to 0 and two sprites overlap with their color code 1 (the dots of two sprites defined by "1" in their bitmap), a sprite collision event occur, and bit 5 ("C") of status register S#0 will be set to "1". This bit will be reset when S#0 is read.

When collision occurs and neither mouse flag (MO) nor the light pen flag (LP) of the register R#8 are set, status registers S#3 to S#6 will contain coordinates of the collision.

When status register S#5 is read, all the contents of registers S#3 to S#6 are reset. This means that program should read status registers S#3, S#4 and S#6 before reading status register S#5. Collision coordinates can be calculated using the following formulas: 
```
   X (S#4,S#3),    Y (S#6,S#5) 
   XC=X-12         YC=Y-8
```

### Special rules for sprite color settings

#### Sprite colors in GRAPHIC7 mode

In all graphic modes except GRAPHIC7 mode, sprite display color is determined by the values in palette registers.

In GRAPHIC7 mode the sprite colors are fixed and are not related to contents of palette registers. Table below show these effective values:

Color code = C3 C2 C1 C0  
Green = G2 G1 G0  
Red = R2 R1 R0  
Blue = B2 B1 B0

|C3|C2|C1|C0||G2|G1|G0||R2|R1|R0||B2|B1|B0|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0||0|0|0||0|0|0||0|0|0|
|0|0|0|1||0|0|0||0|0|0||0|1|0|
|0|0|1|0||0|0|0||0|1|1||0|0|0|
|0|0|1|1||0|0|0||0|1|1||0|1|0|
|0|1|0|0||0|1|1||0|0|0||0|0|0|
|0|1|0|1||0|1|1||0|0|0||0|1|0|
|0|1|1|0||0|1|1||0|1|1||0|0|0|
|0|1|1|1||0|1|1||0|1|1||0|1|0|
|1|0|0|0||1|0|0||1|1|1||0|1|0|
|1|0|0|1||0|0|0||0|0|0||1|1|1|
|1|0|1|0||0|0|0||1|1|1||0|0|0|
|1|0|1|1||0|0|0||1|1|1||1|1|1|
|1|1|0|0||1|1|1||0|0|0||0|0|0|
|1|1|0|1||1|1|1||0|0|0||1|1|1|
|1|1|1|0||1|1|1||1|1|1||0|0|0|
|1|1|1|1||1|1|1||1|1|1||1|1|1|

#### Sprite transparency

The state of bit 5 "TP" of register R#8 affects how sprites are displayed, and affects color code 0.

|TP bit value|Behavior|
|---|---|
|TP=0|Color code 0 will be treated as transparent and invisible.<br>All the dots corresponding to â0â bit value in sprite bitmap will be transparent.<br>These dots are considered as non-existent and will not cause collision event.|
|TP=1|Color code 0 will be the code corresponding to color #0 in the palette register.<br>Note that in GRAPHIC7 mode, value of color #0 is predefined and equal to G=0, R=0 and B=0.<br>If sprites will overlap with the dots corresponding to â0â bit value in their sprite bitmap, collision event will be generated.|

## SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

### Alternate display of two graphic screen pages

Two graphics screen pages may be alternatively displayed in G4 to G7 modes automatically. In G4 and G5 modes, the following pages can be displayed alternatively: page 0 and page 1, and page 2 and page3. In G6 and G7 modes, pages 0 and 1 will be alternatively displayed. Please refer to chapter 6.2 for description of page concept.

```
G4/G5 modes:     G6/G7 modes:
+--------+       +--------+
| Page 0 |       |        |
|Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·|       | Page 0 | 
| Page 1 |       |        |
+--------+       |Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·|
| Page 2 |       |        |
|Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·|       | Page 1 | 
| Page 3 |       |        |
+--------+       +--------+
```

### Displaying two graphics screens at 60Hz

Bit 2 "EO" of register R#9 can be used for displaying two graphics screens alternately at 60Hz. Set the odd page pattern layout table in register R#2. Then set bit 2 of register R#9 to 1.

### Interlace display

This function displays the first and the second fields on the same page: set the bit 3 "IL" of the register R#9, to 1. To display even page in the first field and odd page in second field, set odd page in pattern layout table register R#2, and set both bits 2 "EO" and 3 "IL" in register R#9, to 1.

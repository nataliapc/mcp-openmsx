# READ

## Effect

Returns next value(s) that has been stored in the program source by using `DATA` instructions.

## Syntax

`READ <Variable>,<Variable>...`

_Note: Parameters can not end with a comma alone._

## Parameter

`<Variable>` is a variable that matches with the datatype stored in `DATA` instruction.

After `READ` instruction is executed the data pointer will automatically move to next item. Data pointer can be moved manually by using `RESTORE` instruction.

50 PRINT B
60 DATA "TEST",10,20
Â
